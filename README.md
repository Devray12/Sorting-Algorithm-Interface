# Technologies
•Programming Language:<br />
&emsp;Python - The application is developed using Python.<br />
•Libraries:<br />
&emsp;Tkinter - A built-in Python library used to create the GUI for this sorting algorithm interface.<br />
&emsp;messagebox - A Tkinter module used for displaying error messages if invalid input is entered.<br />

# Description
•This application is a simple, interactive interface for sorting numbers using different sorting algorithms. It allows users to enter a list of numbers and choose from five popular sorting methods: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. After selecting the desired sorting algorithm and clicking the "Sort" button, the application displays each pass of the sorting process, helping users understand how each algorithm works step-by-step.

# Key Features
•Simple GUI: User-friendly interface using Tkinter for easy navigation.<br />
•Algorithm Selection: Choose from Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, or Quick Sort.<br />
•Step-by-Step Display: Shows each sorting pass to illustrate the sorting process.<br />
•Error Handling: Validates input and displays error messages for non-numeric values.<br />
•Real-Time Sorting: Executes and displays sorting results instantly after user input.<br />
